Howdy y'all!

I got stuck on page 39 of Pro Git, 2nd Edition, looking for the configuration files.

The section is: First-Time Git Setup. Nowhere in that section did I see the reality that the config files don't exist after install until you set your identity.

So, I emailed Scott, who told me the files don't exist by default. I replied to him that my first Git project would be to change the section so others didn't have the same confusion.

This project is the result of my efforts.

Many thanks to Bucky Roberts' YT Git Tutorials which I used during this project.

Aloha.. Allen
